# RECOMMENDED USAGE GUIDELINES - Google Reviews Scraper Pro

## IMPORTANT NOTICE

This software is distributed under the MIT License, which grants extensive freedom to users. The following guidelines are **recommendations only** and reflect best practices for ethical and lower-risk usage of the Google Reviews Scraper Pro software ("the Software"). These guidelines are not legally binding restrictions beyond what is already established in the MIT License.

## 1. RECOMMENDED USAGE

I strongly recommend limiting the use of this Software to:

a) **Internal Business Use**: Businesses collecting and analyzing reviews specifically about their own business entities from Google Maps.

b) **Self-Monitoring**: Using the data for monitoring your own online reputation, analyzing customer feedback, and improving your services.

c) **Data Backup**: Creating backups of your own business reviews to protect against data loss.

## 2. USAGE CAUTIONS

I advise against the following uses that may carry higher legal or ethical risks:

a) **Competitor Analysis**: Collecting reviews about competitors or other businesses that you do not own.

b) **Mass Collection**: Collecting reviews from multiple businesses without authorization.

c) **Republication**: Publishing collected reviews on other websites without proper attribution.

d) **Deceptive Practices**: Using collected data for fake reviews or review manipulation.

e) **Reselling Data**: Selling or commercially exploiting the collected review data.

## 3. LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS

While I cannot offer legal advice, I believe users should be aware:

a) **Terms of Service**: Using web scraping tools may potentially conflict with Google's Terms of Service. Users should evaluate this risk independently.

b) **Legal Context**: Web scraping exists in a complex legal landscape that varies by jurisdiction. What is permissible in one region may not be in another.

c) **Privacy Regulations**: Review data may contain personal information subject to privacy laws such as GDPR, CCPA, and others. Users should ensure their data handling practices comply with applicable regulations.

## 4. BEST PRACTICES

To minimize potential issues, I suggest:

a) **Reasonable Rate Limiting**: Implement appropriate delays between requests to avoid overloading servers.

b) **Minimal Collection**: Only collect the data you genuinely need for legitimate purposes.

c) **Attribution**: Maintain proper attribution to review authors and Google when using the collected data.

d) **Data Security**: Implement appropriate security measures to protect any collected review data.

e) **Consult Professionals**: When in doubt about the legality of your specific use case, consult with legal professionals familiar with digital law in your jurisdiction.

## 5. REMINDER OF MIT LICENSE PROVISIONS

This software is provided under the MIT License, which:

a) **Permits**: Commercial use, modification, distribution, private use.

b) **Requires**: Preservation of copyright and license notices.

c) **Disclaims**: All warranties. The authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the software or its use.

## 6. FINAL NOTE

These guidelines represent my recommendations for responsible use of the Software. They are not additional restrictions beyond the MIT License. While the MIT License grants you significant freedom in how you use the Software, I believe that following these guidelines promotes ethical use and helps users navigate the complex landscape of web scraping activities.

By focusing on your own business's reviews and maintaining respectful practices, you can derive value from the Software while minimizing potential risks.
